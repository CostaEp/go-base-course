# Go Short Course - Learning by Doing

## Overview
Welcome to this **Go Short Course**, where we take a **hands-on approach** to learning the Go programming language. Instead of just watching tutorials, we **learn by building** practical projects. Each lab in this course is designed to reinforce key programming concepts through real-world examples.

### The Learning Approach
I found that the **best way to learn** is by **creating guides and projects** from what I study. This course is built using this approach‚Äîtaking concepts from a great tutorial and expanding on them with structured labs.

### Course Inspiration
All the material for this course is based on the **free 100-minute Go course** by [Purple School | Anton Larichev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dS7aT-s_H0&t=3189s&ab_channel=PurpleSchool%7CAntonLarichev). A huge thanks to Anton for his **clear explanations and excellent teaching**! üôå

## What We Will Learn
This course is divided into **three structured labs**, each progressively expanding our knowledge of Go:

### **Lab-01: Basics of Variables and Constants**
- Learn how to **declare and use variables** in Go.
- Understand **constants** and their importance.
- Explore different **data types**.
- Perform basic **IMT (Index of Mass of the Body) calculations**.

### **Lab-02: Expanding Our Knowledge - Functions in Go**
- Understand how to **define and use functions**.
- Learn how to **pass parameters and return values**.
- Refactor the IMT calculator using **modular functions**.
- Improve **code readability and structure**.

### **Lab-03: Finalizing a Structured IMT Calculator**
- Implement **advanced function usage**, including **multiple return values**.
- Accept **user input** efficiently.
- Organize code using **best practices for maintainability**.
- Build a **fully functional, interactive IMT application**.

## How to Use This Repository
Each lab is self-contained and includes:
- A **README.md** file explaining the concepts covered.
- Well-documented **Go code** to follow along.
- Instructions to **compile and run** the code.

### Running a Lab
To start coding, navigate to the desired lab directory and execute:
```sh
# Navigate to a specific lab
cd lab-01-basics  # Example for Lab 01

# Build and run a Go program
go build -o binary_name main.go
./binary_name
```

## Acknowledgments
